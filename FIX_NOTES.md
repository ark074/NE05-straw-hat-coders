This project was inspected and some Docker-related files were (re)generated automatically by the assistant.
Please review:
- Dockerfiles created/updated for backend, frontend, nginx, and celery_worker (if present).
- docker-compose.yml created at project root with contexts pointing to project root and explicit dockerfiles.
- requirements.txt created in backend if missing (auto-inferred based on imports).

IMPORTANT: The assistant cannot reliably infer all dependencies or exact run commands (like your app entrypoint).
You should edit the backend Dockerfile CMD to the correct start command (e.g., uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000)
or the Django manage.py runserver command as appropriate.
